where the lines come to an end. But today that changes when we find out how many lines it actually has. This was actually an
acctendal disovery, but none the less. Let's explain!
# Explaination (Discovery #1 - The Excel)
So While I was testing for the txt file I tried it out and accidentally found out the end of the lines in excel, If this can
be proven wrong please contact me!
# How to test it yourself.
